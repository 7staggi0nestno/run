Xuan Kong Flying Star Feng Shui is a branch of classical Feng Shui that originated from the Xuan Kong School of Feng Shui. It is based on the concept of the Lo Shu Square, a 3x3 grid that contains the numbers 1 to 9 arranged in such a way that they add up to 15 in any direction. Each number represents a star that has a certain quality and influence on the environment.
 
By using the Lo Shu Square and the 24 Mountains compass, Xuan Kong Flying Star Feng Shui practitioners can calculate the flying stars chart of any building based on its orientation and construction date. The flying stars chart shows the distribution of the nine stars in the nine sectors of the building, and how they change over time according to different periods and years. Each star can have a positive or negative effect on the occupants depending on its location and interaction with other stars.
 
The goal of Xuan Kong Flying Star Feng Shui is to harmonize the energy of the building with the energy of the occupants, and to enhance the auspicious stars and remedy the inauspicious stars. This can be done by using various Feng Shui tools such as colors, shapes, elements, objects, plants, water features, and symbols. By applying Xuan Kong Flying Star Feng Shui correctly, you can create a balanced and supportive environment that attracts good luck and prosperity.
