## Step 3: Run Digi Loader 1 .exe
 
Open a terminal window on your host computer and navigate to the directory where you saved Digi Loader 1 .exe. Then, run the following command:

    $ digiloader 1.exe -d  -i 

where <device> is the name of your Digi Connect device (such as cc6ul) and <image> is the name of the DEY image file that you want to flash on your device (such as dey-image-qt-x11-cc6ul.sdcard).</image></device>
 
The tool will detect your device and start transferring the image file to it. You will see some messages on the terminal window indicating the progress of the operation.
 
When the operation is completed, you will see a message like this:

    $ Successfully flashed  on .

Your device will reboot automatically and load the new image.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy your custom Linux system
 
You can now use your Digi Connect device with the DEY image that you flashed on it. You can access the console of your device using a serial cable or a JTAG adapter, or connect it to a monitor and a keyboard using an HDMI cable and a USB hub.
 
You can also use the Yocto Project tools and the meta-digi layer to customize your image further or create your own applications for your device.

## Step 5: Update your device with Digi Loader 1 .exe
 
If you want to update your device with a newer or different DEY image, you can use Digi Loader 1 .exe again. Just follow the same steps as before, but use the new image file name instead of the old one.
 
Digi Loader 1 .exe will overwrite the existing image on your device with the new one. You don't need to erase or format your device before flashing it.
 
However, if you want to revert to the original factory image that came with your device, you will need to use a different tool called Digi Recovery Tool. This tool will restore your device to its original state and erase any customizations that you made on it.
