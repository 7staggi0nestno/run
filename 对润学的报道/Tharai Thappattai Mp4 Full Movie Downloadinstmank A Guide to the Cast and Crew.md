Tharai Thappattai is a 2016 Tamil-language musical art film written, produced and directed by Bala.

The film revolves around the lives of a folk dance troupe led by Sannasi (Sasikumar), who struggles to preserve their art form in the face of modernisation and exploitation. Sooravali (Varalaxmi), a spirited dancer in the troupe, is in love with Sannasi, but he does not reciprocate her feelings. Their lives take a turn when Sooravali agrees to marry Karuppaiah (R. K. Suresh), a ruthless moneylender who has ulterior motives.
