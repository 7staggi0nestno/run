Now that you have installed and activated Waves CLA Classic Compressors, you might be wondering how to use them effectively on your tracks. Here are some tips and tricks to get you started:

- Add character to drums with the CLA-76 Blacky and Bluey plugins, and use the "All" button mode for aggressive compression. The Blacky has a slower attack and a faster release than the Bluey, making it more suitable for punchy drums. The Bluey has a faster attack and a slower release than the Blacky, making it more suitable for smooth drums[^1^].
- Use the CLA-2A plugin on vocals at high gain reduction settings. The CLA-2A is a smooth and transparent compressor that can tame vocal dynamics without adding artifacts. It also adds a subtle warmth and presence to the vocal tone[^1^].
- Add character to instruments such as acoustic guitars using the CLA-2A at moderate settings. The CLA-2A can enhance the natural sound of acoustic instruments by adding some compression and leveling. It can also smooth out any harsh frequencies and add some sparkle to the high end[^1^].
- Use the CLA-3A plugin on bass and electric guitars at low to moderate settings. The CLA-3A is a fast and punchy compressor that can add some weight and tightness to bass and electric guitars. It can also bring out some harmonic distortion and saturation that can make the instruments sound more lively and rich[^1^].

These are just some of the ways you can use Waves CLA Classic Compressors on your tracks. Of course, you can experiment with different settings and combinations to find your own sound. The key is to use your ears and trust your taste. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to use these plugins, only what sounds good to you.
