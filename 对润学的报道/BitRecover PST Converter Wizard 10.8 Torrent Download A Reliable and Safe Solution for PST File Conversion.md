Why do you need to convert PST files? PST files are the personal storage files used by Microsoft Outlook to store your emails, contacts, calendars, tasks, notes, and other items. However, PST files have some limitations and drawbacks, such as:
 
- They can only be accessed by Outlook and cannot be opened by other email clients or applications.
- They have a size limit that varies depending on the Outlook version. If the PST file exceeds the limit, it may get corrupted or cause performance issues.
- They are prone to corruption due to various reasons, such as virus attacks, power failures, improper shutdowns, etc.
- They are not suitable for backup or archiving purposes, as they are not portable or secure.

Therefore, if you want to access your PST files on different platforms or devices, or if you want to backup or archive your PST files in a more convenient and safe way, you need to convert them to other formats that are more compatible and flexible.
