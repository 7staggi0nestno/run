Planiol was not only a jurist but also a historian of Brittany, his native region. He wrote several books and articles on the public and private law of Brittany, as well as its customs and institutions. He contributed to the *Grande EncyclopÃ©die* of AndrÃ© Berthelot and won an award from the AcadÃ©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques for his work on Breton law.[^1^]
 
Planiol was also a respected teacher and mentor to many students and colleagues. He taught at the University of Rennes and then at the Sorbonne, where he succeeded Charles Beudant. He taught various subjects, such as Roman law, inheritance, labor law, patent law, and criminal law.[^1^] He was known for his clear and rigorous exposition of legal principles and rules. He also collaborated with Georges Ripert, who became his successor and editor of his treatises.
 
Planiol died in 1931 in Paris at the age of 77. He left behind a legacy of legal scholarship and education that influenced generations of civil law jurists and practitioners. His treatise on elementary civil law remains a classic of French jurisprudence and a valuable source of legal knowledge and reasoning.

The translation aimed to make Planiol's work accessible to English-speaking jurists and to show the similarities and differences between French and Louisiana civil law.
