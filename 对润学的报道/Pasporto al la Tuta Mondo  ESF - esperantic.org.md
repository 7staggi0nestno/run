# Pasporto al la Tuta Mondo: A Fun and Easy Way to Learn Esperanto
 
Esperanto is a planned international language that was created in the late 19th century by L. L. Zamenhof, a Polish ophthalmologist. He hoped that Esperanto would foster peace and understanding among people of different cultures and backgrounds. Today, Esperanto is spoken by millions of people around the world, who use it for travel, education, literature, music, and friendship.
 
If you are interested in learning Esperanto, one of the best resources available is Pasporto al la Tuta Mondo (Passport to the Whole World), a video course that consists of 15 lessons of 30 minutes each, plus a 16th lesson with a summary, history and original music. The course was produced by the Esperantic Studies Foundation (ESF), a non-profit organization that promotes research and education in Esperanto and related fields.

Pasporto al la Tuta Mondo is designed to be fun and engaging, with an entertaining story line that follows the adventures of the Bonvolo family and their friends. The Bonvolo family is no ordinary family: the father, Georgo, is a Greek philosopher and the mother, Filisa, is a dancer. The harmony of this somewhat extraordinary family is upset when a young shepherd, complete with sheep, decides to take advantage of the Pasporta Servo (Passport Service), a network of Esperanto speakers who offer free accommodation to travelers. The resulting complications and misunderstandings provide the basis for a fast-moving and lively story that will hold your attention until the end.
