The main feature of Carel 1tool is that all these components are integrated into a single software product to ensure the highest efficiency of programming. In fact, each component is intended to perform its part of the task and interacts with the other components to provide the developer with:
 
- The highest reliability thanks to error notifications that appear directly at the stage of creating the development;
- The reduction of development time thanks to the use of new available functions, as well as new libraries of modules;
- The flexibility in developing applications.

All these possibilities, the new graphics and the user-friendly interface make Carel 1tool a great product that meets all the needs of applications for ventilation and air conditioning systems.

One of the main advantages of Carel 1tool is that it offers a vast library of functions for HVAC/R applications. These functions are called atoms, macroblocks and modules, and they are based on consolidated and secure logic that can precisely respond to the different design needs. For example, you can find functions for temperature control, fan speed control, humidity control, alarm management, communication protocols, and more.
 
To use these functions, you can access the graphical editor of Carel 1tool, which allows you to create your application by dragging and dropping the desired elements on a workspace. You can also customize the parameters and properties of each element according to your specific requirements. The graphical editor also provides you with a simulation mode, where you can test your application before uploading it to the controller.
