# Redshift 2.6.41 | 441 MB: A Fast and Flexible GPU Renderer
 
If you are looking for a production-quality renderer that can leverage the power of your GPU, you might want to check out Redshift 2.6.41. This version of Redshift is compatible with NVIDIA GeForce RTX SUPER cards, which offer improved performance and memory over the previous generation[^5^]. Redshift 2.6.41 also brings new features and improvements, such as a new Sky and Sun Model, Flakes Shader, Camera Backplates, and more[^4^].
 
Redshift is a biased renderer that allows you to adjust the quality of individual techniques to get the best balance between speed and accuracy. It supports complex shading networks and texturing capabilities, as well as photorealistic lighting and effects. Redshift can also handle large scenes with millions of polygons and instances without running out of memory, thanks to its out-of-core architecture[^4^].

Redshift integrates seamlessly with popular 3D applications such as Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Foundry Katana, SideFX Houdini, and ZBrush. You can use Redshift as a standalone application or as a plugin for any of these applications without any additional cost[^4^]. Redshift also supports industry standard formats and workflows, such as Alembic, OpenVDB, OpenColorIO, and more.
 
Redshift 2.6.41 is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. You can download it from the official website or from your Maxon account if you have a Cinema 4D subscription. The file size is about 441 MB, which is relatively small compared to other renderers. You will need an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA compute capability 5.0 or higher to run Redshift. The minimum recommended VRAM is 4 GB, but more is recommended for complex scenes and high resolutions[^4^].

Redshift is one of the most popular GPU renderers in the market, used by many studios and artists for feature films, TV shows, commercials, games, and more. Some of the notable projects that used Redshift are Deadpool 2, Lost in Space, Black Panther, The Lego Movie 2, Game of Thrones, and Stranger Things[^4^]. If you want to join the Redshift community and learn more about this amazing renderer, you can visit the official forum or watch some tutorials on YouTube.
  
One of the advantages of Redshift is that it can scale well with multiple GPUs. You can use up to eight GPUs per machine to speed up your rendering times. You can also use network rendering to distribute your render jobs across multiple machines with Redshift licenses. Redshift supports both local and cloud-based network rendering, so you can choose the option that suits your needs and budget.
 
Another benefit of Redshift is that it has a flexible and user-friendly interface. You can use the Redshift RenderView to preview your renders interactively and make adjustments on the fly. You can also use the Redshift AOVs to output different render elements for compositing and post-processing. Redshift supports a variety of AOVs, such as beauty, diffuse, specular, reflection, refraction, depth, normal, motion vector, and more.
 
Redshift also has a rich and diverse online community that can help you with any questions or issues you might encounter. You can find many resources and tutorials on the official website, forum, YouTube channel, Facebook group, and Discord server. You can also browse the Redshift Gallery to see some amazing artworks created by other Redshift users. You can also submit your own work and get feedback from other artists.
