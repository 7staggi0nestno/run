## What do you need to scan 3D objects with DAVID Laserscanner Professional Edition?
 
To scan 3D objects with DAVID Laserscanner Professional Edition, you need the following hardware:

- A PC with Windows operating system.
- A camera: This can be a web cam, a digital camera, or a video camera. The camera should have a manual focus and exposure control, and a resolution of at least 640x480 pixels.
- A background corner: This is a flat surface that forms a right angle, such as a wall corner or a cardboard box. The background corner should be large enough to fit the object you want to scan.
- A hand-held laser: This can be any type of laser that projects a line onto the object, such as a laser pointer or a laser level. The laser should have a wavelength of around 650 nm (red) and a power of less than 5 mW.
- A tripod or a stand: This is optional but recommended to stabilize the camera and the laser.
